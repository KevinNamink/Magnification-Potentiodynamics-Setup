Made with the Orca camera in the setup.

10 mu m devisions from thorlabs slide in bright field (a flashlight was put on top of the slide to press it down firmly and to light it well)

Immersion oil was used and the translatable stage was at "4" for one of the turn things (the second smallest you can turn), (I dont know how it works)
